# Environment-mapping-and-3D-Point-Cloud-by-YDLIDAR-X4-360

Constructing 3D Point Cloud of a scanned area by using YDLIDAR X4 360 degrees scanner. It receives spatial data from the laser scanner and constructs a 3D Point Cloud of an area. The following picture is the output of the environment that i have scanned.

Using the SLAM method, a 2D Grid Map is created and the trajectory of the moving sensor is recorded and illustrated.
The following picture is the output of the environment that i have scanned.

Without illustration of the trajectory path.
